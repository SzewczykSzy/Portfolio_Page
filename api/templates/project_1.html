            <p class="lead text-muted py-2">The goal of this thesis project was to design an algorithm that performs detection 
                of dangerous situations involving pedestrians on the road. For this problem, 3D point clouds acquired from a 
                vehicle-mounted LiDAR device (Ouster OS1-128) were used. The OS1-128 is a time-of-flight (ToF) sensor. This means 
                that it measures distance based on the time-of-flight of a light beam. The device emits light which bounces off 
                the measured object and returns to it. Using software provided by the Ouster manufacturer, the raw data was 
                converted to an array representation.

            <p class="lead text-muted pt-4">After converting point cloud to array representation, the result image was not natural.
                If needed to be converted from stagger to destagger. Also it required scaling, because reflective objects and those
                which emits light on their own, return signal incomparably large relative to other facilities.

                When the data were transformed correctly, the next step was to create a dataset with annotated pedestrians.
                To do that I used Roboflow. I have created dataset with about 1300 images, and after augmentation process increased
                to about 3000 images.

            <p class="lead text-muted pt-3">
                To perform pedestrian detection in the images, I have decided to use a pre-trained YOLOv8 convolutional neural network, which 
                was retrained on the previously created dataset. After the model was ready to use, to perform object tracking I have 
                used a ByteTrack algorithm, which was provided by Ultralytics with default parameters values.
